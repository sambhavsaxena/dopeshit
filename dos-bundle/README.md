### Denial of service attack using C

C is known to be a strong low level language, which is why it is used in many applications. However, this also means that it is very easy to write a program that can cause a denial of service attack. This is because C does not have any built in security features, which means that the programmer has to implement them with every program. This is why it is very important to be careful when writing C programs, with proper memory management, as they can be very dangerous and may result in memory leakages.

### How to run the program

Some operating systems do not allow running scripts directly on the terminal. In this case, you can run the program by typing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
chmod +x dos.sh
```

This will allow the program to be executed. Then, you can run the program by typing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
./dos.sh
```
